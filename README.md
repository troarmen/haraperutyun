* Full trust in the Trastamad's direction.

## 2. THE PIPELINE (STEPS)

### STEP_01: THE GEOPOLITICAL GATE
The first decryption key is hidden within the 14th Five-Year Plan of the country you currently represent.
> **CHALLENGE:** Find the password for the next stage in the following link: [LINK_PARA_DOCUMENTO_ONU_CHINA]
>

> 
> **HINT:** The "Comment" field contains your coordinates.

### STEP_03: THE PYTHON LOGIC TRACE
You don't need to be a developer to understand the logic of my intent.
> **CHALLENGE:** Solve the code snippet below to generate the Final Endpoint URL.

```python
# MISSION LOGIC
days_until_montreal = 25 # Estimation
fire_intensity = 100
gift_id = "B31J4R" # Exemplo

def get_target(d, f):
    key = (d * f) / 2
    return f"bit.ly/target-{key}"

# PERFORM TRACE TO DEPLOY
