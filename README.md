# 🛡️ MISSION: PROTOCOL 0214 // RESET & REDEPLOY
**STATUS:** AUTHORIZED BYPASS (FEBRUARY ISOLATION PERIOD)
**SECURITY CLEARANCE:** LEVEL 7 (MONTHS_IN_RELATIONSHIP == 7)
**ENCRYPTION:** HIGH-INTENSITY MASCULINE VISION

## 0. INTRODUCTION
Anna, this documentation serves as your ONLY authorized roadmap during the 0214 window. 
I am in silence, but my vision for our future in Canada is active. 
This is not a gift; it is a test of your intelligence, memory, and focus.

"The superior man leads with vision; the feminine follows with trust."

## 1. PREREQUISITES
To successfully complete this pipeline, you must possess:
* Memory of our first week in Armenia.
* Geopolitical knowledge of the Chinese delegation (UN context).
* A browser with Developer Tools access.
* Full trust in the Captain's direction.

## 2. THE PIPELINE (STEPS)

### STEP_01: THE GEOPOLITICAL GATE
The first decryption key is hidden within the 14th Five-Year Plan of the country you currently represent.
> **CHALLENGE:** Find the password for the next stage in the following link: [LINK_PARA_DOCUMENTO_ONU_CHINA]
> **HINT:** Look for the specific term I highlighted during our strategy talk.

### STEP_02: THE CRYPTOGRAPHIC HANDSHAKE
A physical image carries the weight of 1000 words, but a file carries hidden data.
> **CHALLENGE:** Inspect the Metadata (EXIF) of the image sent to your secure e-mail.
> **HINT:** The "Comment" field contains your coordinates.

### STEP_03: THE PYTHON LOGIC TRACE
You don't need to be a developer to understand the logic of my intent.
> **CHALLENGE:** Solve the code snippet below to generate the Final Endpoint URL.

```python
# MISSION LOGIC
days_until_montreal = 25 # Estimation
fire_intensity = 100
gift_id = "B31J4R" # Exemplo

def get_target(d, f):
    key = (d * f) / 2
    return f"bit.ly/target-{key}"

# PERFORM TRACE TO DEPLOY
